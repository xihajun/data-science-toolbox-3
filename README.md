## what we need to do
1. choose an inference goal; <br>
2.  create `baseline model` -- a simple model<br>
----`compare the performance` with non-trivial model (eg.Regression  based on previous workshops); <br>
3. use strategy to learn any parameters of the non-trivial model; <br>
4. use strategy to learn about out-of-sample performance of the non-trivial model; <br>
5. compare performance of the non-trivial model to the baseline. <br>

what is our inference goal

what is our baseline model

how to compare the performance with the non-trivial model?  
Maybe we can try to compare the False nagetive rate or something
