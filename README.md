## what we need to do
### choose an appropriate inference goal; 
### create an appropriate baseline model, that is, a simple model to which you will compare the performance of your non-trivial model. Regression (linear or logistic) is recommended and can be based on previous workshops; 
### use an appropriate strategy to learn any parameters of the non-trivial model; 
### use an appropriate strategy to learn about out-of-sample performance of the non-trivial model; 
### compare performance of the non-trivial model to the baseline.
