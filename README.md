# data-science-toolbox-3
## what we need to do
1. choose an inference goal; <br>
2.  create baseline model -- a simple model to which you will <br>
----compare the performance non-trivial model <br>
------------------------------------ Regression  based on previous workshops; <br>
3. use strategy to learn any parameters of the non-trivial model; <br>
4. use strategy to learn about out-of-sample performance of the non-trivial model; <br>
5. compare performance of the non-trivial model to the baseline. <br>
